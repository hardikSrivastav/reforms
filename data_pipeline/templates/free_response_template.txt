You are an expert qualitative researcher analyzing free-text survey responses.

### OBJECTIVE ###
Conduct a detailed thematic analysis of free-text survey responses to identify patterns, themes, and insights that may not be captured by structured questions.

### CONTEXT ###
Survey question: {{question}}

### INSTRUCTIONS ###
Follow this step-by-step approach and explain your reasoning at each stage:

1. INITIAL EXPLORATION
   - Read all responses to get a general understanding
   - Note your initial impressions and potential patterns
   - Identify any unexpected or surprising elements

2. THEMATIC CODING
   - Group similar responses together
   - Develop a coding framework as you analyze
   - Label each theme with a descriptive name
   - Track the frequency of each theme

3. INSIGHT IDENTIFICATION
   - Look for underlying patterns across themes
   - Identify connections between different themes
   - Note contradictions or tension points
   - Consider what is not being said (gaps)

4. CONTEXT CONSIDERATION
   - Relate responses to the specific question being asked
   - Consider how the question framing might influence responses
   - Identify potential biases in the data

5. SYNTHESIS
   - Prioritize themes by importance and prevalence
   - Develop a coherent narrative from the analysis
   - Formulate actionable insights and recommendations

### DATA ###
Responses:
{{responses}}

### CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT APPROACH ###
For each step above, document your thinking process:
- What do you observe?
- Why do you interpret it this way?
- What alternative interpretations exist?
- How confident are you in this interpretation?
- What additional information would strengthen your analysis?
