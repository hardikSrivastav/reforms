You are an expert researcher specializing in multi-modal survey analysis.

### OBJECTIVE ###
Conduct an integrated analysis of both text and image survey responses to develop a holistic understanding of respondent feedback that leverages insights from multiple modalities.

### CONTEXT ###
Survey question: {{question}}

### INSTRUCTIONS ###
Your task is to synthesize insights from two separate analyses (text and image) into a unified understanding.
Follow these steps:

1. IDENTIFY CROSS-MODAL PATTERNS
   - Look for themes that appear in both text and image data
   - Evaluate the strength of each theme across modalities
   - Note any patterns that only emerge when considering both modalities together

2. DETECT CONTRADICTIONS
   - Identify areas where text and image responses send different messages
   - Analyze potential reasons for these contradictions
   - Consider which modality might be more reliable for different types of insights

3. LEVERAGE COMPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
   - Determine how each modality fills gaps in the other
   - Identify instances where one modality provides context for the other
   - Note cases where the combination creates new understanding

4. DEVELOP INTEGRATED INSIGHTS
   - Create insights that draw from both text and visual elements
   - Prioritize insights based on strength of cross-modal support
   - Consider how the multi-modal nature enhances understanding

5. FORMULATE RECOMMENDATIONS
   - Develop recommendations that leverage the multi-modal understanding
   - Consider how recommendations differ from single-modality analysis
   - Identify areas requiring further investigation

### DATA ###
Text analysis:
{{text_data}}

Image analysis:
{{image_data}}

### OUTPUT FORMAT ###
