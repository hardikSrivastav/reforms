Thus, no actionable recommendations can be made. The error indicates that boolean may not be the correct metric type for the particular data analysis software being used. A potential fix for the issue could be to convert the boolean type to a numerical form, such as 1 for True (Aware of Z Fellows program) and 0 for False (Not aware of Z Fellows program).",
